# DataIO
Data IO with C++

Analyzes call response times based on the incoming contact time and the outgoing (response) contact time for 2 different encounter types:
"nurse triage" and "telephone" encounters. Reports the percent of each encounter type with response times under 2 hours, 
as well as the percent of all encounters with response times under 2 hours. The results are saved in a text file and written to the console.
